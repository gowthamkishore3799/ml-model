## Algorithms and Datasets

### 1. **Classification Algorithms**
- **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet powerful model used for binary classification tasks. It works by estimating probabilities using a logistic function, suitable for cases where the dependent variable is categorical.
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Based on Bayes' theorem, this algorithm assumes independence between features and is highly effective for text classification tasks, especially with large datasets.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions. It handles overfitting well and is highly effective for both classification and regression tasks.
- **Gradient Boosting**: A powerful ensemble technique where models are built sequentially, with each new model focusing on the errors made by previous ones. It's known for its high predictive accuracy.
  
**Dataset:** [Phishing Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset)  
**Description:** Classifies emails as phishing or non-phishing based on their textual content and metadata.

### 2. **Clustering Algorithms**
- **K-Means**: A centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions the dataset into K clusters, minimizing the variance within each cluster. It's widely used for customer segmentation and anomaly detection.
- **DB-SCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: A density-based clustering method that identifies arbitrarily shaped clusters by analyzing the density of points. It's effective for handling outliers and irregularly shaped data.
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**: A probabilistic model that assumes all data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. It's flexible and can model complex cluster shapes compared to K-Means.
  
**Dataset:** [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset)  
**Description:** Groups customers into clusters based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.

### 3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **CNN Architecture**: A deep learning model primarily used for image-related tasks. It consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to automatically learn features and make predictions from input images.
  
**Dataset:** [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist)  
**Description:** A dataset containing grayscale images of clothing items used for image classification tasks, including shirts, trousers, shoes, and more.
